# Project Title
This project stimulates the transactions in a banking system. HTML, CSS, JS has been used in the front end and PHP on the server side. Ajax is used to dynamically reflect changes.

## Project Setup

**Step 1: Installing all the required softwares**
1. [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
2. [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/)

**Step 2: Cloning the project**
1. Once installation is completed, create a folder named ```Banking-System``` in the location ```C:\xampp\htdocs```.
2. Then open the command prompt and clone your fork of this repository inside ```Banking-System``` using ```git clone <fork link> .```
3. Replace the password in ```connection.php``` with the password you have set up for your SQL Database.
4. Now, we need to initialize the database in the local system. For this, run the queries given in ```initialize.sql``` in MySQL Command Line or MySQL Workbench.
5. And now, your project is ready to run.

**Step 3: Running the project**
1. Open XAMPP Control Panel and start MySQL and Apache Server.
2. Open ```index.html``` and you will find the project running.


##### NOTE: If you have changed the database name in the query then change it in other files too. So, avoid changing the database name.
